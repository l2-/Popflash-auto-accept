## Popflash-auto-accept
### How to install
There is no store page for this as I do not have a developer account.
Note that by installing it from the source code it will not auto update.\
To install it manually:
1. Download the repository: [Download](https://github.com/l2-/Popflash-auto-accept/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Extract the downloaded zip file.
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. On this page click `Load unpacked`.

To toggle the auto accept feature On or Off, Pin the extension so the popflash icon shows up in the bar. 
Click this icon to toggle.
